# 🧠 LeetCode Mastery – Chris Low

Welcome to my curated collection of LeetCode problems, organized by topic with explanations and clean solutions.

This repo is part of my ongoing effort to **understand patterns**, avoid common mistakes, and improve my problem-solving speed. I use it as both a **personal learning journal** and a **revision tracker**.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `arrays/`
  - `121-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock.py`

- `tracker.csv` – Problem ID, title, topic, revisit flag, etc.
- `README.md` – Main repo overview (you are here)

## 🧩 What You'll Find for Each Problem

In each `.py` file, I aim to include:

- Problem title and link
- My own explanation or summary
- Initial brute-force thoughts (if any)
- Optimized approach and key insights
- Mistakes or tricky edge cases I encountered
- What I learned and whether I need to revisit

---

## ✅ Why I Chose This Format

- **Simple folder structure**: Organized by topic, not difficulty
- **CSV tracker**: Easy to sort/filter for review
- **Inline notes in `.py` files**: Keeps everything in one place while coding

---

## 🔁 Revisit Philosophy

When I struggle with a problem, I mark it in `tracker.csv` and schedule it for retry. No grind — just targeted review.

---

## 🧠 Future Goals

- Add more tags per problem (e.g. `sliding_window`, `greedy`, `dfs`)
- Build a markdown dashboard with links to all problems
- Add difficulty filters and revisit counters
